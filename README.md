## Overview
PLATE.AI is a full-stack web application demonstrating a complete, end-to-end pipeline for high-accuracy Vietnamese license plate detection and recognition. The system features a custom-trained YOLOv11n model, a real-time processing backend, and a modern, interactive frontend built with React.

This project is designed not only as a functional tool but also as a comprehensive showcase of modern AI and web development practices, from data preparation and model training to deployment and user interface design.


## ‚ú® Key Features
High-Accuracy AI Model: At its core, the application utilizes a custom-trained YOLOv11n model. This model was trained for 150 epochs on a specialized dataset of over 3,300 Vietnamese license plate images, achieving a high mean average precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.993.

# Multi-Modal Input: Users can analyze license plates from static images, video files, or directly from a live webcam feed, demonstrating the model's versatility in different scenarios.
# Advanced OCR Engine: The system employs a specialized ONNX-based OCR engine via the FastPlateOCR library, ensuring rapid and precise character extraction from the detected plates.
# Real-Time Analytics Dashboard: The application features a dynamic dashboard that visualizes the model's cumulative performance. This includes an interactive donut chart showing the success rate and live-updating statistics on total images processed and accuracy.
# Modern & Responsive UI: A fully responsive interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, featuring smooth animations (Framer Motion), a Lottie-based hero section, and a persistent light/dark mode toggle.
# Multi-Plate Detection: The backend is architected to identify, process, and return data for all license plates found within a single image or video frame.
## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
The project is built on a modern, robust stack, cleanly separating the frontend and backend concerns.

# Frontend
Framework: React
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Animations: Framer Motion & Lottie
Charting: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2
API Communication: Axios
# Backend
Framework: FastAPI (Python)
AI/ML Libraries: PyTorch, Ultralytics (YOLO), OpenCV
OCR Engine: fast_plate_ocr (ONNX-based)
## üß† AI Model Architecture & Training
The performance of PLATE.AI is driven by a carefully trained computer vision model.

## Architecture: The model is based on the YOLOv11n (nano) architecture, chosen for its excellent balance of speed and accuracy. It features 181 layers and 2,590,230 parameters.
Training Environment: The model was trained in a Google Colab environment using a Tesla T4 GPU for acceleration.
Dataset: A custom dataset named License_Plates_VietNam.v3i.yolov11 was used, containing 3,391 training images and 1,044 validation images.
Training Process:
The model was trained for 150 epochs.
An AdamW optimizer was automatically selected.
A batch size of 16 and an image size of 640x640 were used.
Performance: After 150 epochs, the model achieved the following metrics on the validation set:
mAP50-95: 0.917
mAP50: 0.993
This high level of precision demonstrates a highly reliable model for detecting both long and short Vietnamese license plates under various conditions.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To run this project locally, you will need to set up both the backend and frontend services.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ and pip
Node.js and npm
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

'''

cd backend
Create and activate a virtual environment:

'''

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required Python packages:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the FastAPI server:

Bash

uvicorn main:app --reload
The backend API will now be running on http://localhost:8000.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory in a new terminal:

Bash

cd frontend
Install the required Node modules:

Bash

npm install
Start the React development server:

Bash

npm start
The frontend application will open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The application follows a standard client-server architecture:

User Interaction: The user selects an input mode (photo, video, or camera) on the React frontend.
API Request: The selected media is sent to the FastAPI backend. For streams, frames are sent sequentially.
Plate Detection: The YOLOv11 model processes the incoming frame to find bounding boxes for all potential license plates.
OCR Processing: Each detected bounding box is cropped and sent to the FastPlateOCR engine, which recognizes the characters.
JSON Response: The backend aggregates the results and sends a JSON payload containing the recognized text, confidence score, bounding box coordinates, and a Base64-encoded image of the crop for each detection.
Display Results: The React frontend receives the JSON data, updates the analytics dashboard, and renders the results visually by drawing boxes over the preview and displaying the cropped plate images.
